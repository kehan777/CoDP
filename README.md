# CoDP (Contrastive-learning-based Distogram Prediction Model)
<img width="2126" height="324" alt="supple_new_画板 1-01" src="./fig/CoDP.png" />

Integrated with HalluDesign, the CoDP model serves as a fast, distogram-based ranking tool. It leverages contrastive learning to quickly screen sequences by their predicted structural compatibility, facilitating a more efficient design cycle. This capability directly enhances the stability of monomeric proteins and improves the specificity of protein-ligand interactions.

We also implement modified LigandMPNN in our code.

# Installation
if your already installied HalluDesign, you no need to install this package.
```
mamba create -n CoDP python==3.11
conda activate CoDP
# for Ligandmpnn
cd LigandMPNN 
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install transformers==4.49.0
bash get_model_params.sh "./model_params"
```
# Inference
```
python CoDP_MPNN.py --input_file .pdb --output_dir ./test --mpnn ligand_mpnn --esmhead

CoDP_MPNN.py [-h] [--pdb_list PDB_LIST] [--input_file INPUT_FILE] [--fix_res_index FIX_RES_INDEX]
                    [--fix_chain_index FIX_CHAIN_INDEX] --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR [--num_seqs NUM_SEQS] [--esmhead]
